### 1. Figure script
Contains scripts to plot main and supplement figures.

### 2. Uniform pipeline
Contains scripts to perform uniform pipeline(Fig. S1) on different algorithm.

### 3. Processing code
Contains other scripts to get count, length, consistency, PR-AUC and other metrics.

### 4. Diff signal predict
Contains a pipeline for differential signal enhancer prediction with H3K27ac ChIP-seq and DNase-seq data.
